# Heuristic-graph-based-task-planner
Heuristic graph based task planner for table top manipulators (handles occupancy issues and stacking in scenes)

## Tasks
- [x] Target place occupancy detection 
- [x] Fast and optimal buffer place sampler using marching grid algorithm (original work (marching grid is an already existing optimization method))
- [x] Stack-relationships detection using ray casting (original work)
- [x] Fast and optimal buffer spot sampling using object kernel convolutions method (original work)
- [x] Height map based grasp modification (Original work)
